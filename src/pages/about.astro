				<h2 class="h3 fw-bold mb-4">Why We Love Oak Island</h2>
				<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
					Our family has always loved the beach, and when it came time to choose where to invest our hearts and resources, Oak Island was the clear choice. This special place offers everything we value most: small town charm without the crowds, miles of pristine shoreline, and a genuinely dog friendly atmosphere that welcomes our furry family members with open arms.
				</p>
				<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
					Some of our favorite memories here include walking the dogs on the beach at sunrise, going to the point where the ocean meets the inlet, and ghost crab hunting with flashlights after dark – a tradition that never gets old, no matter how many times we do it. There's something magical about Oak Island that keeps us coming back.
				</p>
				<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
					We spend our summers here whenever possible and sneak away at every opportunity to relax and recharge by the sea. Oak Island isn't just a vacation destination for us – it's become our home away from home, a place where we can truly unwind and reconnect with what matters most.
