## Pro Tips from Pet-Loving Hosts

1. **Rinse paws after beach visits** - Salt and sand can be irritating
2. **Bring a large towel** - For drying off sandy, wet pups
3. **Check tide schedules** - Low tide offers more beach space for running
4. **Consider a wagon** - For tired pups on long beach walks
5. **Pack extra food** - Beach air makes everyone hungrier!
